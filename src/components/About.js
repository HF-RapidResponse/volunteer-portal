      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Humanity Forward is excited you are here! Our volunteers and grassroots
        supporters are the heart of this human-centered movement, and we are hard
        at work rewriting the rules of the economy to work for us, the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This movement is powered by you - the supporters of ideas from Andrew Yang.
        Many of the ideas Andrew championed during his presidential run are still
        at the heart of Humanity Forward. In addition to his advocacy of Universal
        Basic Income, universal healthcare, and efforts to provide cash relief to
        those who are affected by COVID, he also supports down ballot candidates
        and partnerships with other other organizations through this organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have many volunteer opportunities available and we canâ€™t wait to get you
        plugged in! Change and forward momentum can only happen through our volunteers,
        and we are so thankful you are here!
