# Setup

To get a dev environment ready on your computer, you'll need a few things installed.

## Git

Git needs to be installed to handle code branching and merging. It can be installed from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you're not familiar with git fundamentals, read these two guides:

- [Udemy](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/).
- [Kataclda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git)

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Feel free to use whichever IDE you'd like. There is no hard requirement for an IDE. Many of the developers here use Visual Studio Code. It's lightweight and offers a variety of extensions. However, we'll list a few IDEs below:

- [Visual Studio Code (a.k.a. VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio (regular purple VS)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

## Extensions

There are some ESLint files in this repo. For those using VS Code, `ESLint` will allow users to take advantage of these files to handle things like syntax errors and formatting. For more info on ESLint, read [their website](https://eslint.org/). Another helpful add-on is `Prettier` that helps with code formatting (makes it looks pretty!).

## Docker

To run this app locally, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) must be installed. Docker is used to create containerized environments for each aspect of the volunteer portal. You can read over the [docker-compose.yaml](../docker-compose.yml) file to see a list of all environments created.
